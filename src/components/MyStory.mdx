It's 2016, and I have lived in Medellin for 13 years now. It's my first year in college. I was going for a Civil engineer degree (how wrong was I ðŸ˜‚ ).
It wasn't until mid-2018 when I changed my degree (the best decision I've ever made).

There is not much more to tell at the time so let me make you a summary. Throw the rest of the time for 2019 (lovely year, we know what happens next years) to the actual time I continued my degree as a Software engineer.

Finally, I'm next to graduate in mid-2022 and I'm anxious about what the labor life will bring, but always with my best attitude to face the challenges that are about to come.
