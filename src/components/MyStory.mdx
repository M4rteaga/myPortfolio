A long time ago in Bogota, Colombia. A beautiful child was born ...

It's 2016, and I have lived in Medellin for 13 years now. It's my first year in college. I was going for a Civil engineer degree (how wrong was I ðŸ˜‚ ).
It wasn't until mid-2018 when I changed my degree (the best decision I've ever made).

There is not much more to tell about that time so let me make you a summary. Through the rest of the time for 2019 (a lovely year, we know what happened next year) to the present day, I have continued my degree as a Software engineer.

Finally, I'm next to graduate in mid-2022 and I'm anxious about what the labor life will bring, but always with the best attitude to face all challenges that are about to come.
